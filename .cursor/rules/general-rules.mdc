     When structured, step-by-step reasoning will be helpful.

-    **Use `context7-mcp`**

     -    When adding or updating project dependencies.
     -    When there is an error related to interaction with existing libraries.
     -    For documentation descriptions.

-    **Update `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`**

     -    After implementing or updating features or dependencies (not a bugs/issues), keep the file in
          sync with the project state.

-    **Update `PROJECT_ISSUES.md`**
     -    If there is some bug/issue - check this file for searching a solution or help.
     -    After fixing the bug/regression bug add the short description and solution to the file for future.
