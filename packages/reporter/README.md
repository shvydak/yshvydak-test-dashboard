### 🆕 Progress Tracking (v1.0.1+)

The reporter now sends real-time progress updates to the dashboard:

```
🧪 Running Tests              − ✕
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 43%
6 of 14 tests                 43%

✅ Passed: 5        ❌ Failed: 0
⏭️ Skipped: 1       ⏸️ Pending: 8

Currently Running:
🔄 API - Link Budget Item
   e2e/tests/api/api.test.ts
🔄 API - Create Contract
   e2e/tests/api/api.test.ts

⏱️ Elapsed: 3s   Est. remaining: ~4s
```

**Features:**
- See exactly which tests are running
- Track passed/failed/skipped/pending counts in real-time
- Get time estimates for test completion
- Floating panel that can be minimized
- Auto-hides after test completion

**How it works:**
The reporter uses Playwright's `onTestBegin()` and `onTestEnd()` lifecycle hooks to send progress updates to the dashboard via WebSocket. No configuration needed - it works automatically!

## Troubleshooting

### Reporter Not Sending Data

**Symptom:** Tests run but no data appears in Dashboard

**Solution:**

1. Verify Dashboard server is running:
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
    ```
2. Check `DASHBOARD_API_URL` environment variable:
    ```bash
    echo $DASHBOARD_API_URL
    ```
3. Run diagnostics:
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:3001/api/tests/diagnostics
    ```
