## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm 10+
- Existing Playwright project

### 1. Install and Setup

```bash
# Clone the dashboard
git clone https://github.com/yshvydak/yshvydak-test-dashboard.git
cd yshvydak-test-dashboard

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build all packages
npm run build
```

### 2. Install Reporter in Your Test Project

```bash
# Navigate to your Playwright project
cd /path/to/your/playwright/project

# Install the reporter
npm install --save-dev playwright-dashboard-reporter
```

**Important:** No changes to `playwright.config.ts` are needed. The Dashboard automatically adds the reporter when running tests via CLI flag `--reporter=playwright-dashboard-reporter`.

Your `playwright.config.ts` remains unchanged and can keep existing reporters:

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts - NO CHANGES NEEDED
import {defineConfig} from '@playwright/test'

export default defineConfig({
    reporter: [
        ['html'], // Your existing reporters continue to work
        ['list'],
    ],
})
```

### 3. Configure Dashboard for Your Project

Create a `.env` file in the project root to configure the dashboard:

```bash
# Create .env file in project root
cp .env.template .env

# Edit .env and update the path to your test project:
PLAYWRIGHT_PROJECT_DIR=/path/to/your/playwright/project
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
VITE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001

# Authentication Configuration
ENABLE_AUTH=true
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@admin.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=qwe123
JWT_SECRET=dev-jwt-secret-change-in-production-12345
```

**Note:** All other variables are automatically derived from these core settings. For production deployment, use strong passwords and secure JWT secrets. See [Authentication Documentation](docs/features/AUTHENTICATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md) for detailed security setup.

### 4. Start the Dashboard

```bash
# Start the dashboard (reads configuration from .env automatically)
npm run dev
```

The dashboard will be available at:

- **Web UI**: http://localhost:3000 (or your VITE_PORT value)
- **API**: http://localhost:3001 (or your PORT value)

### 5. Login and Discover Tests

1. **Open the dashboard** in your browser
2. **Login** with your admin credentials (admin@admin.com / qwe123 for development)
3. **Click "Discover Tests"** to scan your project
4. **Run tests** directly from the UI or rerun failed ones
5. **Monitor results** in real-time!

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Running Tests

#### From Dashboard (Recommended)

- **Discover Tests**: Scans your Playwright project for all available tests
- **Run All**: Execute all tests with live monitoring
- **Run by File**: Run specific test files
- **Rerun Failed**: One-click rerun of any failed test

#### From Command Line

Your existing test commands work unchanged:

```bash
npx playwright test  # Uses standard reporters
```

When the dashboard runs tests, it automatically adds the custom reporter:

```bash
npx playwright test --reporter=playwright-dashboard-reporter
```

### Monitoring and Results

- **Live Updates**: Real-time test status via WebSocket
- **Rich Results**: Enhanced error messages with code context
- **Attachments**: View screenshots, videos, and traces inline
- **Execution History**: View all past test runs with independent artifacts for each execution
- **Filtering**: Find tests by status, file, or timeframe

### Troubleshooting

#### Health Check

Visit `/api/tests/diagnostics` for integration status:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/tests/diagnostics
```

#### Common Issues

1. **Tests not appearing**: Check `PLAYWRIGHT_PROJECT_DIR` environment variable
2. **Reporter not working**:
    - Verify `playwright-dashboard-reporter` is installed: `npm list playwright-dashboard-reporter`
    - Check Dashboard is running and `PLAYWRIGHT_PROJECT_DIR` points to correct test project
    - Dashboard passes `DASHBOARD_API_URL` to reporter automatically via environment
3. **Connection issues**: Ensure dashboard is running on correct port
4. **Package not found errors**: Run `npm install --save-dev playwright-dashboard-reporter` in your test project
5. **Test count inconsistency**: If test discovery shows different counts than after test execution:
    - Discovery finds fewer tests: Check if all test files are being scanned properly
    - Fewer tests after execution: Usually resolved by API limit parameters (dashboard uses `limit=200`)
    - See [Test Display Architecture](docs/TEST_DISPLAY.md) for technical details

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Monorepo Structure

```
packages/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/      # Shared TypeScript types
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reporter/  # Playwright reporter source code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server/    # Express API + SQLite + WebSocket
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ web/       # React + Vite dashboard UI
```

### Dynamic Reporter Integration

The dashboard uses **dynamic reporter injection** - no changes needed to your `playwright.config.ts`:

1. **npm Package**: Dashboard uses `playwright-dashboard-reporter` from your test project's `node_modules`
2. **Test Discovery**: Dashboard scans your project with `playwright test --list`
3. **Dynamic Injection**: When running tests, adds `--reporter=playwright-dashboard-reporter` CLI flag
4. **Clean Separation**: Your `playwright.config.ts` stays unchanged
5. **Automatic Mode**: Reporter reads configuration from Dashboard environment variables

### Architecture Improvements

The dashboard follows clean **Layered Architecture** principles with recent refinements:

- **Pure Service Injection**: Streamlined dependency injection without legacy components
- **Optimized Routes**: Removed unused endpoints, focused on active functionality
- **100% Compatibility**: All existing integrations continue to work seamlessly

More details: [TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md)

### Environment Variables

The dashboard uses a **simplified .env configuration** with automatic derivation of most values:

```bash
# Core Configuration (5 variables + auth)
PORT=3001                                    # API server port
NODE_ENV=development                         # Environment mode
PLAYWRIGHT_PROJECT_DIR=/path/to/your/tests   # Test project location
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001               # Base URL for all services
VITE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001          # Base URL accessible to web client
VITE_PORT=3000                               # Web dev server port (optional)

# Authentication Configuration
ENABLE_AUTH=true                             # Enable authentication
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@admin.com                  # Admin user email
ADMIN_PASSWORD=qwe123                        # Admin user password
JWT_SECRET=dev-jwt-secret-change-in-production-12345    # JWT signing key

# All other variables are derived automatically:
# - DASHBOARD_API_URL = BASE_URL (for API integration)
# - VITE_API_BASE_URL = BASE_URL/api (for web API calls)
# - VITE_WEBSOCKET_URL = ws://BASE_URL/ws (for WebSocket)
# - OUTPUT_DIR = test-results (default storage)

# Advanced users can still override any derived variable
```

**Port Management:**

- **API Server**: Uses `PORT` (default: 3001)
- **Web Dev Server**: Uses `VITE_PORT` if set, otherwise `PORT + 1000`, fallback: 4001
- **Production**: Both services can run on same port with different paths
