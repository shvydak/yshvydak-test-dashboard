# Archived Documentation

This folder contains historical documentation that is no longer actively maintained but preserved for reference.

## Why These Documents Are Archived

### CODE_OPTIMIZATION.md
**Status**: Completed and integrated
**Reason**: Production optimization work completed in October 2025. Key points integrated into main documentation.
**Relevance**: Historical reference for optimization decisions made during authentication implementation.

### TIMESTAMP_MANAGEMENT.md
**Status**: Integrated into ARCHITECTURE.md
**Reason**: Timestamp management now described in Architecture and API Reference docs. No need for separate document.
**Relevance**: Historical context for timestamp field decisions (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `timestamp`).

### TEST_DISPLAY.md
**Status**: Issue resolved
**Reason**: Test count consistency issues have been fixed. Discovery and display now match correctly.
**Relevance**: Historical documentation of the problem and solution for test ID generation and SQL query optimization.

### SIMPLIFIED_ENV_CONFIGURATION.md
**Status**: Merged into CONFIGURATION.md
**Reason**: Environment configuration details now part of main Configuration guide. Eliminated duplication.
**Relevance**: Historical context for 5-variable simplification approach and port derivation logic.
